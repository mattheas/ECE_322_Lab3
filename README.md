# ECE_322_Lab3


## Lab3_1:

The file mybisect.py is given. It is a program that attempts to find the root of a function f(x) between a given interval. 

The file test_mybisect.py uses white box testing techniques (i.e. unit tests) to provide:
- Statement coverage
- Branch coverage
- Execution each loop body at least twice (enter the loop and repeat)

The test cases are written using the python unittest testing framework assertion statements. A self-illustrated Control
Flow Graph is used to determine if the aforementioned coverage is met.
